      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        We believe in the power of generosity and community. Our vision is to
        foster a sustainable and connected world by making it easy for people to
        give and receive without the exchange of money. By facilitating the
        reuse and redistribution of items, we aim to reduce waste and promote
        environmental stewardship. Additionally, we are dedicated to supporting
        bee conservation efforts, recognizing the crucial role bees play in our
        ecosystem.

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        At FreeBee Life, everything is straightforward and user-friendly. Users
        can list items they no longer need, making them available for others to
        claim for free. Whether you have clothes, electronics, furniture, or
        books, you can give them a new home with someone who needs them. It's as
        simple as:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>List Your Items: </b>Snap a photo, write a brief description, and
            post your item on our platform.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Browse for Free: </b> Explore a wide range of free items listed
            by other users in your area.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <b>Connect and Exchange: </b> Contact the lister to arrange a pickup
            or drop-off. Enjoy the benefits of sharing and receiving within your
            community.
          </li>
